# Refined Pipes [![CurseForge](http://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/full_370696_downloads.svg)](http://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/refined-pipes)

Refined Pipes is a Minecraft mod that adds pipes.

It is my goal to have the best standalone (no external dependencies, no special ores/ingots required) item, fluid and energy transport pipes in modded Minecraft.

Similar to Refined Storage, I don't want people to think too much when using this mod, it should stay simple in use. That doesn't mean I won't be adding lots of features, though.
